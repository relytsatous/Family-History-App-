            <li>And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among the people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given (3 Nephi 8:4)</li>
            
                <li>   dubious = with a sense of two minds, undecided between two things" </li>
                <li>  James 1:6-8 : But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
                    For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. 
                    A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.  </li>
                    <li>διψυχος = wavering, uncertain </li>
                    <li> vs. steadfast and immovable - 3 Nephi 6:14; Mosiah 5:15 </li>
                    Is Uncertainty always due to lack of faith or is it due to the Lord withholding answers?

                            <li>1 Nephi 16 - murmuring against the Lord: complaining is a sign of faithlessness/doubt. "By small means are great things brought to pass"</li><
