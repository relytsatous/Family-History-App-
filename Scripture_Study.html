            And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among the

          <li> James 1:6-8 : But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he
            that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
            tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing
            of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. </li>
          <li>διψυχος = wavering, uncertain</li>

          <li>
            Is doubt always due to lack of faith or is it due to the Lord

          We all have fears, anxieties, and trials in this life that make it difficult at times to put our faith in the Lord and trust that what He asks us to do is best. Sometimes doing the right thing requires courage, and sometimes it can be difficult or uncomfortable....Whether it’s choosing to keep the commandments when it contradicts the world’s opinions or following the teachings of our prophets and apostles when it is unpopular, doing what’s right with faith will always bring about miracles and joy.

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <div>
            Keeping the law of chastity takes courage. It is healthy to have sexual feelings for another person as long as they are used appropriately. How are sexual feelings to be used appropriately in dating? According to Moroni, chastity and virtue are dear and precious above everything else. As a priesthood holder and disciple of Christ, I do not want to deprive any person I date of their chastity and virtue.</div>
